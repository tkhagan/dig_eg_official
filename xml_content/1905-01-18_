<head>NOTES FROM SUAKIN.</head>

<head>PROGRESS AT SHEIKH BARGHOUT. SIR W U AUSTIN'S INSPECTION</head>

<p>Suakin, January 10.</p>
<p>Sir William Garstin, G.C.M.G., Adviser to the Ministry of Public Works, accompanied by Miralai Macauley Bey, R.E., Director of Sudan Railways, and Bimbashi Sowerby, R.E., Chief Engineer of Ways and Works, Suakin-Atbara Railways, left for Railhead on the 4th inst. in a special train composed of four saloon car- riages on inspection duty, returning to Suakin at noon on the 7th inst. The same afternoon, Sir Wm. Garstin,accompanied by Macauley Bey, inspected the piers and the works at Graham’s Point. His Excellency expressed his entire sa- tisfaction with what he saw, and with the great progress made in such a short space of time, and under many difficulties.</p>
   <p>On the 8th inst. Sir William Garstin, accompanied by Macauley Bey and Drury Bey, Controller of Sudan Ports, left on H.H. Ports and Lighthouses steamer "Aida," which was followed by the Sudan Port steam tug "Hawk," for Sheikh Barghout harbour. After the party had landed and inspectedthis new port. Sir Wm. Garstin went on to Suez by the “Aida," and Macauley Bey and Drury Bey returned to Suakui by the "Hawk.</p>
   <p>The British steamer "Sharistan" arrived here from England with a large consignment of railway material and stores for the Sudan Government Railway on the 4th inst.</p>
   <p>H.M.S. "Sealark" (Commander Somerville) arrived here from Sheikh Barghout on the 4th inst. and left again for surveying purposes on the 7th inst.</p>
   <p>One officer and 35 N.C.O.’s and men belonging to the Works Department arrived here on the 7th inst. from Khartoum vià Berber, and are leaving for Sheikh Barghout. They form the pioneer party and will start the publie works there. They will soon be followed by about 1,000 more men from the name department coming viA Suez. The total number of men to be sent to Sheikh Barghout in connection with the public works there will amount to about 3,000.</p>
   <p>The anniversary of the accession to he thrown of'H. H. the Khedive was observed as a general holiday, all Government offices and works being closed for the occasion. At midday a salute of 21 guns was fired from the Customs' Quay, and the town was en fete by day as well as by night.</p>
   <p>The Khédivial mail steamer "Missir" arrived here a few days ago from Suez with a consignment of timber, etc., for the temporary wooden bridges to be erected for the Suakin- Atbara Railway. The "Missir” returns to Suez to-day.

<head>THE PICNIC GIRL.</head>

<head>WHAT SHE HAS TO PUT UP WITH.</head>

   <p>The Picnic Girl goes out for pleasure ; but she has much to put up with. She must mix the salad, and keep the earwigs out of it, and she mustn’t scream when a spider walks over her hand. Sometimes a burst of rain spoils her pretty frock but she must still look cheerful and try to pretend that she likes it. And these showersdomore than spoil frocks, as a Liverpool lady told her friend the other day. "I was a girl at a picnic, and got drenched to the skin, she said. "And I have blamed that picnic ever since for the way I have suffered with rheumatism.</p>
<p>"Only those who havo ever suffered from that dreadful malady can have any idea of the

</figure>

awful pain I had at times to bear. For week after week I have been bed-ridden. Besides which I had that miserable languor which is so horribly depressing. At night I have often been in too great pain to sleep.</p>
<p>"There was hardly a part of my body which was not at one time or another affected with the rheumatism," continued the speaker (Mrs. Moorcroft, of 88, Leven street, Kirkdale, Liverpool). "My appetite almost completely left me, and when I did get the length of walking even a few yards I soon became tired out, both with the pain and difficulty experienced in breathing. I de-paired, after I had suffered in the way I have described for many years, of ever being like other people again. Nothing did me any good until I tried Dr. Williams’ pink pills. Three boxes effected an improvement, and as I preservered with them a little time I soon felt quite well again, and have been so now for a long time. My appetite has returned ; I am able to sleep ; I have no pain, and I find pleasure in working."</p>
<p>Mrs. Moorcroft’s case is like many others. She needed new blood to cure her rheumatism, and Dr. Williams' pink pills cured her by making new blood, just as they have cured so many cases of anaemia, bile, consumption, decline, fits, St. Vitus’ dance, hysteria, and the many troubles which women silently endure. It is important to insist on having genuine pills, with Dr. Williams’ name, as some shopkeepers push useless substitutes.</p>

<Head>THE SON OF EX- U. S. MINISTER TO ENGLAND</Head>

<head>Commends Pe-ru-na to All Catarrh Sufferers.<head>

<p>Hon. Louis E. Johnson is the son of the late Roverdy Johnson who was Uni ted States Senator from Maryland, also Attorney General under President Johnson, and United States Minister to England, and who was regarded as the greatest constitutional lawyer that ever lived.</p>
<p>In a recent letter from 1006 F St., N. W., Washington, D.C., Mr. Johnson says: "No one should longer suffer from catarrh when Peruna Is accessible. To my knowledge It has caused relief to so many of my friends and acquaintances, that it is humanity to commend Its use to all persons suffering with this distressing disorder of the human system."...Louis E. Johnson.</p>

<head>Catarrh Poisons.</head>

<p>Catarrh is capable of changing all the life-giving secretions of the body Into scalding fluids, which destroy and In-flame every part they come In contact with. Applications to the places affected by catarrh can do little good save to soothe or quiet disagreeable symptoms. Hence It is that gargles, sprays, atomizers and inhalants only serve as temporary relief.</p>

<p>There is bat one remedy that has the desired effect, and that remedy is Pe-runa. This remedy strikes at once to the roots of catarrh by restoring to the capillary vessels their healthy elasticity. Peruna is not a temporary palliative, but a radical cure.
